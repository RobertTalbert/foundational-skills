The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of one of the data structures we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Lucke, T. (2014). Using learning analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach. In _Proceedings of the 2014 Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference_ (pp. 1-9). Massey University.

2.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions were addressed?

    -   The paper tries to quantify the effects that the flipped classroom approach had on the performance of students on their course assessment tasks.


3.  What made this a “good” data product?

    -   It was professionally laid out, and the visualizations were done properly (scatterplots comparing two quantitative variables, regression models and signifance included) and contributed to the overall research questions. 

4.  In your self-selected article, who were the intended beneficiaries of the work and what “change ideas” might the result imply for them?

    -   Beneficiaries are mainly instructors running flipped classes. The most surprising results were how weak the correlations were between some of the variables, especially time spent on videos and scores on quizzes. 
    
5. Finally,  how were modeling used to support analysis, if at all? Were these practices new to you?

    -   The regression models provided the most insights. Most people could guess there was going to be an overall positive relationship between time spent on videos and quiz scores; but the extent of that positivity and the relative weakness of the relationship only come through the regression analysis. 

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Analytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions is  addressed?

    -   So, you could modify the study above and replace quiz scores with scores on a self-regulation instrument like the MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire). The question would be, is there a relationship between time spent engaging with flipped classroom materials, and average scores on a subset of the questions on the MSLQ or an average of selected scores from across the MSLQ? That is, is there any kind of relationship between self-reported self-regulation items and time spent engaging with class materials? 

2.  Briefly describe how you might “polish” a data visualization for the educators you will share it with?
 
    - Most of the sharing I would ever do with educators is through social media or presentations, so I'd want to create graphics that are colorful, easy to read at a distance, and aren't overly complicated. I'd want to use color to convey information when it makes sense, make all the objects in the visualization a little larger than I would for a print publication, and not have a lot of unnecessary items in the visualization. 

3.  How might you include education practitioners (e.g teachers, admin, policymakers, etc) to be involved in the study?

    -   Find a group of instructors teaching the same course who would be willing to give the MSLQ to their students (not an insignificant thing since it has 70+ questions on it) and share their students' engagement data from the LMS. 

### Part II: Data Product

We have completed the phases of the Learning Analytics Workflow but really have only scratched the surface with the power of tidyverse in each of these phases.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, your goal for this lab is to complete a data product. 
You have two options for completing the Data Product portion:

- Create a data product of your choice using a data set from the data folder 
- Create a data product using your own data.

Exercise:
- You will create a data product to share with stakeholders.

1.  **Select**. Communicating what one has learned involves selecting
    among those analyses that are most important and most useful to an
    intended audience, as well as selecting a form for displaying that
    information, such as a graph or table in static or interactive form,
    i.e.a "data product."
    
    # WHAT EVENTUALLY GOES HERE - Student data from F2020, their responses 
    # to the questions about "how often does X instructional practice happen" 
    # and their overall satisfaction. Any relationships of note between the frequency
    # of the good practices and the overall satisfaction score? 
    # Saved as inst_practices.csv 

2.  **Polish**. After creating initial versions of data products,
    research teams often spend time refining or polishing them, by
    adding or editing titles, labels, and notations and by working with
    colors and shapes to highlight key points.

3.  **Narrate**. Writing a narrative to accompany the data products
    involves, at a minimum, pairing a data product with its related
    research question, describing how best to interpret the data
    product, and explaining the ways in which the data product helps
    answer the research question.


I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-3 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

```{r, my-data-product}
# YOUR FINAL CODE HERE
```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Foundation Badge on Learning Analytics Data Product! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by:

1. Change the name of the author: in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn’t actually display in the final output.

2. Click the yarn icon above to “knit” your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3. Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4. Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):
Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) by clicking the “Publish” button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account. Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).

5. Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [Foundations Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/foundations/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and `write` a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you’d like to explore further.
