The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will complete a few R exercises that demonstrates your ability to apply the first phases of the LA workflow and data wrangling techniques introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan

Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of the Learning Analytics Workflow we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Jovanović, J., Gašević, D., Dawson, S., Pardo, A., & Mirriahi, N. (2017). Learning analytics to unveil learning strategies in a flipped classroom. _The Internet and Higher Education_, 33(4), 74-85.

2.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions were addressed?

    -   What kinds of learning strategies do students actually use when doing pre-class work in a flipped learning environment (e.g. watching videos and accessing reading materials) -- not self-reported but as evidenced through data from the LMS? 


3.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that detailed in your article or presentation. 

    -   Trace data (data about access, length of time engaged with materials, etc.) were pulled from the LMS. Then converted into a quadruple made up of of event id, student id (anonymized), type of learning action, and timestamp. Those were then converted into a sequence of events in a format used by the [TraMineR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/TraMineR/index.html) R package which is apparently used to examine such sequences. Then the researchers performed a cluster analysis on the data. 
    
4.  What were the key findings or conclusions? What value, if any, might education practitioners find in these results?

    -   The researchers found four main clusters that represent different manifestations of study strategies (one dominated by formative assessment strategies, one by summative assessment strategies, one focused on completing reading materials but low engagement with activities, and one focused on completing videos).
    - Similarly there were five clusters of students based on their predeliction toward different combinations of strategies (intensive, strategic, highly strategic, selective, and highly selective) . 
    - The value in these clusters comes in knowing what kinds of strategies students are using, what kinds of students are using them, and how individual student choices of strategies might lead to better coaching and interventions with those students. 
    

5. Finally, how, if at at, were educators in your self-selected article involved prior to wrangling and analysis?

    -   It doesn't appear that individual educators were involved at all other than granting permission to get student data off the LMS. The study involved just one section of an engineering course -- couldn't tell if the course belonged to one of the authors. 

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Analytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions is  addressed??

    -   How does the grading method for pre-class work in a flipped learning environment impact student engagement with the course materials for the assignment? (Specifically - will students engage with pre-class videos, readings, and assignments differently if you grade pre-class work using points based on correctness versus pass/no pass on the basis of completeness and effort only?) 

2.  Briefly describe any steps of the data-intensive research workflow that can be detailed in your article or presentation.
 
  - First, get student engagement data off of course LMS
  - Then think about how to clean it - what do you do about NAs, what about massive outliers, etc. 
  


3.  How, if at all, will your article touch upon the application(s) of LA to “understand and improve learning and the contexts in which learning occurs?”

    -   "Making sure students do the pre-class work" is a huge issue in flipped learning and a bottleneck in the entire flipped learning pedagogical process. Anything we can discover that would make this work better is super worthwhile. 

### Part II: Data Product

In our Learning Analytics code-along, we scratched the surface on the number of ways that we can wrangle the data.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, your goal for this lab is to extend the Learning Analytics Workflow from our code-along by preparing and wrangling different data.

*Or alternatively, you may use your own data set to use in the workflow. If you do decide to use your own data set you must include:* 

- *Show two different ways using `select` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

- *Show one way to use `filter` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

- *Show one way using `arrange` function with your data, inspect and save as a new object.*

- *Use the pipe operator to bring it all together.*

Feel free to create a new script in your lab 2 to work through the following problems. Then when satisfied add the code in the code chunks below. Don;t forget to run the code to make sure it works.

**Instructions:**

1. _Add_ your name to the document in author.

2. Set up the first (or, two if using an Introduction) phases of the LA workflow below. I've added the wrangle section for you. You will need to `Prepare` the libraries necessary to wrangle the data.


## Prepare

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```


## Wrangle

3. In the chunk called `read-data`: _Import_ the `sci-online-classes.csv` from the `data` folder and _save_ as a new `object` called `sci-classes`. Then _inspect_ your data using a `function` of your choice.


```{r, read-data}
sciclasses <- read.csv(here("data", "sci-online-classes.csv"))
head(sciclasses)
```



4. In the select-1 code chunk: Use the 'select' function to  _select_  `student_id`, `subject`, `semester`, `FinalGradeCEMS`. _Assign_ to a new object with a different name (you choose the name).
```{r, select-1}

subset_sciclasses <- sciclasses %>%
  select(c(student_id, subject, semester, FinalGradeCEMS))

summary(subset_sciclasses)
```
*

What do you notice about FinalGradeCEMS?(*Hint: NAs?)
 
 - About 5% (30 out of 603) of the FinalGradeCEMS observations are NAs. 


5. In code chunk named `select-2` _select_ all columns except `subject` and `section`. _Assign_ to a new object with a different name. _Examine_ your data frame with a different `function`.
```{r, select-2}
subset2_sciclasses <- sciclasses %>%
  select(-c(subject, section))

glimpse(subset2_sciclasses)

```

6. In the code chunk named `filter-1`, _Filter_ the sci_classes data frame for students in OcnA courses. _Assign_ to a new object with a different name. _Use_ the head() function to examine your data frame. 
 
```{r, filter-1}
oceans_eleven <- sciclasses %>%
  filter(grepl("OcnA", course_id))
head(oceans_eleven)
```

Q: How many rows does the head() function display?
*Hint: Check the dimensions of your tibble in the console.*

- 6. 


7. In code chunk named `filter-2`, _filter_ the sci_classes data frame so rows with NA for points earned are removed. _Assign_ to a new object with a different name. _Use_ glimpse() to examine all columns of your data frame.

```{r, filter 2}
no_nas <- sciclasses %>% 
  filter(!is.na(Points_Earned))

glimpse(no_nas)
```

8. In the code chunk called `arrange-1`, _Arrange_ `sci_classes` by `subject` then `percentage_earned` in descending order. _Assign_ to a new object. _Use_ the str() function to examine the data type of each column in your data frame.

```{r}
sorted_sciclasses <- sciclasses %>%
  arrange(subject, desc(percentage_earned))

str(sorted_sciclasses)
```

9. In the code chunk name `final-wrangle`, _use_ `sci_classes` data and the %>% `pipe` operator: 
  + Select `student_id`, `subject`, `semester`, `FinalGradeCEMS`. 
  + Filter for students in OcnA courses.
  + Arrange grades by section in descending order. 
  + Assign to a new object. 
  + Examine the contents using a method of your choosing. 
  
```{r}
the_final_countdown <- sciclasses %>%
  select(c(student_id, subject, semester, FinalGradeCEMS)) %>%
  filter(subject == "OcnA") %>%
  arrange(desc(FinalGradeCEMS))

head(the_final_countdown)
```
