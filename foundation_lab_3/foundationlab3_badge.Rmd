The final activity for each learning lab provides space to work with data and to reflect on how the concepts and techniques introduced in each lab might apply to your own research.

To earn a badge for each lab, you are required to respond to a set of prompts for two parts: 

-   In Part I, you will reflect on your understanding of key concepts and begin to think about potential next steps for your own study.

-   In Part II, you will create a simple data product in R that demonstrates your ability to apply a data analysis technique introduced in this learning lab.

### Part I: Reflect and Plan
  
Use the institutional library (e.g. [NCSU Library](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/#articles)), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) or search engine to locate a research article, presentation, or resource that applies learning analytics analysis to an educational context or topic of interest. More specifically, **locate a study that makes use of one of the data structures we learned today.** You are also welcome to select one of your research papers.

1.  Provide an APA citation for your selected study.

    -   Lucke, T. (2014). Using learning analytics to evaluate the effectiveness of the flipped classroom approach. In _Proceedings of the 2014 Australasian Association for Engineering Education Conference_ (pp. 1-9). Massey University.

2.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions were addressed?

    -   The paper tries to quantify the effects that the flipped classroom approach had on the performance of students on their course assessment tasks.


3.  What are some common approaches EDA approaches used and what did they entail?


    -   THis isn't "EDA" but a series of correlations were done on pairs of quantitative variables coming from students in a flipped class: 
     - Final exam score vs. student GPA
     - LMS quiz scores vs. time spent on video lectures 
     - Final exam scores vs. time spent on video lectures 

4.  How were data visualization or feature engineering used to support analysis, if at all?What were the key findings or conclusions?

    -   The scatterplots between the three pairs of quantitative variables above were used to see if there was any relationship between them. There was (1) a weak relationship between GPA and final exam and (2) somewhat stronger relationships between time spend on video lectures and assessment scores. 
    
5. Finally,  what value, if any, might education practitioners find in these results?

    -   Results aren't terribly surprising here but instructors can show the data to students maybe, and explain that more engagement with the video lectures in a flipped class situation is related to higher grades. 

Draft a new research question of guided by the the phases of the Learning Anlytics Workflow. Or use one of your current research questions.

1.  What educational issue, “problem of practice,” and/or questions is  addressed??

    -   So, what if you did a similar study but instead of using quantitative variables for grades, you used categorical variables -- i.e. standards based grading or the use of a 3- or 4-level rubric? How would that change the results, and how they are visualized and reported? 

2.  Briefly describe any steps of the EDA approach that will be used..
 
    - You couldn't do scatterplots any more because one variable (time spent on video lectures) is quantitative but the response variables (grades) aren't. You could do side-by-side boxplots (one per grade, showing the distribution of time spent) although these might not fully capture how time spent affects the grades. 

3.  What elements of EDA might require human judgement and decision making?

    -   If you went the route of the side-by-side boxplots, human judgment would be needed to see the relationship between the variables that would ordinarily be really visible if it was a scatterplot. Also there wouldn't be any correlation (at least I don't know how you'd do a correlation between qualitative and quantitative -- there probably is some method for that).

### Part II: Data Product

In our Learning Analytics code-along, we only scratched the surface on the number of ways that we can wrangle the data.

Using one of the data sets provided in the data folder, your goal for this lab is to extend the Data Visualizations using `ggplot` for Learning Analytics. 
You have three options for completing the Data Product portion:
You can create the visualization exercise provided.
Create a visualization of your choice using a data set from the data folder 
Create a visualization using your own data.



I highly recommend creating a new R script in your lab-3 folder to complete this task. When your code is ready to share, use the code chunk below to share the final code for your model and answer the questions that follow.

Exercise 1:
- Using the `sci-online to create a basic visualization that:
  + Examine the relationship between two categorical variables.
  + Add an appropriate title to your chart.
  + Add a caption that poses a question educators may have about this data that your visualization could help answer.
. 

```{r, data-viz1}

# Set it all up first 

library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

sciclasses <- read.csv(here("data", "sci-online-classes.csv"))


# Create side-by-side bar plots -- one group per subject, then bars for each semester

## First we need a contingency table, and convert it to a data frame

results <- data.frame(table(sciclasses$subject, sciclasses$semester))

## Now build the plot

ggplot(data = results, aes(x = Var1, y = Freq, fill = Var2)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge(), alpha = 0.75)  +
  ylim(0,125) + 
  labs(x = "Course", y = "Enrollment", title = "Enrollments per semester",
       caption = "How do enrollments in the different courses change from one semester to the next?")
```


Exercise 2:
- Using the `sci-online to create a basic visualization that:
  + examines the relationship between two continuous variables. (scatterplot with layers, 
#' a log-log or line plot, or one using coord functions.)
  + Add an appropriate title to your chart.
  + Add a caption that poses a question educators may have about this data that your visualization could help answer.
  + Add or adjust any aesthetics to improve the 
  readability of visual appeal of your viz. 
  + Use a color scale if appropriate to modify the  default colors used by ggplot. 
  + Adjust or remove your legend as appropriate. 

```{r, data-viz2}
ggplot(sciclasses, aes(x = TimeSpent_hours, y = percentage_earned, color = percentage_earned)) + 
  geom_point(
    # color = "black",
    # fill = "#69b3a2",
    alpha = 0.5, 
    size = 2
  ) + 
  scale_colour_gradientn(colours=rainbow(4)) + 
  labs(x = "Time spent (hours)", y = "Grade (percentage)", caption = "Does one's grade relate to the time spent on the course?")
```

### Knit & Submit

Congratulations, you've completed your Foundation Badge on Learning Analytics Workflow! Complete the following steps to submit your work for review by:


1. Change the name of the author: in the [YAML header](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/yaml-header.html) at the very top of this document to your name. As noted in [Reproducible Research in R](https://monashdatafluency.github.io/r-rep-res/index.html), The YAML header controls the style and feel for knitted document but doesn’t actually display in the final output.

2. Click the yarn icon above to “knit” your data product to a [HTML](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html) file that will be saved in your R Project folder.

3. Commit your changes in GitHub Desktop and push them to your online GitHub repository.

4. Publish your HTML page the web using one of the following [publishing methods](https://rpubs.com/cathydatascience/518692):
Publish on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/) by clicking the “Publish” button located in the Viewer Pane when you knit your document. Note, you will need to quickly create a RPubs account. Publishing on GitHub using either [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or the [HTML previewer](http://htmlpreview.github.io/).

5. Post a new discussion on GitHub to our [Foundations Badges forum](https://github.com/orgs/laser-institute/teams/foundations/discussions/2). In your post, include a link to your published web page and `write` a short reflection highlighting one thing you learned from this lab and one thing you’d like to explore further.
